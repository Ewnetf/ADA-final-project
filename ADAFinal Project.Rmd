## Introduction

Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) blood tests are an emerging
screening technology that aim to detect multiple cancers at an earlier,
more treatable stage. However, public perceptions of these tests—and
whether people view them as valuable—may depend on how much they trust
their doctors and the broader health care system.

In this analysis, we use data from the 2024 Health Information National
Trends Survey (HINTS 7) to examine:

Whether higher trust in doctors is associated with perceiving MCED
tests as highly valuable.

Whether this relationship is affected by respondents’ awareness of
MCED tests.

How this association changes after adjusting for demographic and
health-related factors.
## Methods
```{r}
pacman::p_load(officer,flextable,
dplyr, readr, forcats,
gridExtra, knitr, kableExtra,
mosaic, table1, broom,
survey, car, ResourceSelection
)

# Load HINTS 7 public-use data

load("hints7_public.rda")
ls()
names(public)[1:20]

```
### Variable Selection
We selected variables related to trust in doctors, perceived value of
MCED tests, awareness of MCED tests, and relevant covariates.

```{r}
mced_dat <- public %>%
dplyr::select(
# Main variables
CancerTrustDoctor,   # trust in doctor
ValueMultiCaTest,    # perceived value of MCED
HeardMultiCaTest,    # MCED awareness (mediator)

# Covariates
Age,
BirthSex,
RaceEthn5,
EducA,
HHInc,
HealthInsurance2,
ConfidentMedForms,
TrustHCSystem,

# Survey design / weights
PERSON_FINWT0,
VAR_STRATUM,
VAR_CLUSTER

)

str(mced_dat$Age)

```
### Recoding and Data Management
We recoded variables to create meaningful categories for analysis.
```{r}

###Create Analytic Sample
We excluded respondents with missing data on key variables.
The sample size decreased from 7278 to 5880 after applying these criteria.
```{r}
mced_analysis <- mced_recoded %>%
filter(
!is.na(val_high),
!is.na(trust_high),
!is.na(aware),
!is.na(Sex),
!is.na(age_cat),
!is.na(race_cat),
!is.na(education3),
!is.na(insured),
!is.na(hl_high),
!is.na(sys_trust_high),
!is.na(income3),
!is.na(PERSON_FINWT0),
!is.na(VAR_STRATUM),
!is.na(VAR_CLUSTER)
)

nrow(mced_analysis)

```
### Survey weights and design
We applied survey weights to account for the complex sampling design of HINTS.
```{r}
mced_design <- svydesign(
ids = ~VAR_CLUSTER, # cluster
strata = ~VAR_STRATUM, # strata
weights = ~PERSON_FINWT0, # <<<<<< THIS DOES THE ACTUAL WEIGHTING <<<<<<
nest = TRUE,
data = mced_analysis
)

mced_design
```
##Descriptive Statistics
We generated weighted descriptive statistics for the analytic sample.
```{r}
table1(
~ val_high + trust_high + aware +
Sex + age_cat + race_cat + education3 +
income3 + insured + hl_high + sys_trust_high,
data    = mced_recoded,
caption = "Overall characteristics of HINTS 7 respondents with MCED variables."
)

## Conceptual Model
The conceptual model guiding this analysis is illustrated below.
It posits that trust in doctors influences the perceived value of MCED tests,
potentially mediated by awareness of these tests, while accounting for various
demographic and health-related covariates.

## Regression Analysis

## Regression Analysis



make_or_table <- function(model) {
summ    <- summary(model)
coefmat <- summ$coefficients
ci      <- suppressMessages(confint(model))

data.frame(
term     = rownames(coefmat),
OR       = exp(coefmat[, "Estimate"]),

}


```
### Model 1: Unadjusted (Trust Only, Survey-Weighted)
```{r}
model1_svy <- svyglm(
val_high ~ trust_high,
design = mced_design,
family = quasibinomial()
)

or_m1 <- make_or_table(model1_svy)

kable(
or_m1,
digits   = 3,
caption  = "Survey-weighted unadjusted odds ratio for perceiving MCED as very valuable (trust only).",
col.names = c("Term", "OR", "Lower 95% CI", "Upper 95% CI", "p-value")
) %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)



```


Interpretation (Model 1):
In unadjusted analyses, participants who reported a high level of trust in their doctor had 1.19 times higher odds of perceiving MCED tests as very valuable compared with those reporting less than high trust in their doctor (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.18–1.75, p = 0.0004).
### Model 2: Adding MCED Awareness (Survey-Weighted)
```{r}
model2_svy <- svyglm(
val_high ~ trust_high + aware,
design = mced_design,
family = quasibinomial()
)

or_m2 <- make_or_table(model2_svy)

kable(
or_m2,
digits   = 3,
caption  = "Survey-weighted odds ratios for perceived MCED value: trust and awareness.",
col.names = c("Term", "OR", "Lower 95% CI", "Upper 95% CI", "p-value")
) %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)



```
Interpretation (Model 2):
After adjusting for awareness of MCED tests, the association between trust in doctors and perceived value of MCED tests remained significant, with those reporting high trust having 1.35 times higher odds of perceiving MCED tests as very valuable (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.10–1.66, p = 0.0042). Additionally, awareness of MCED tests was strongly associated with perceived value (OR = 2.50, 95% CI: 2.10–2.98, p < 0.001).
### Model 3: Fully Adjusted Model (Survey-Weighted)
```{r}
model3_svy <- svyglm(
val_high ~ trust_high + aware +
Sex + age_cat + race_cat + education3 +
insured + hl_high + sys_trust_high + income3,
design = mced_design,
family = quasibinomial()
)

or_m3 <- make_or_table(model3_svy)

kable(
or_m3,
digits   = 3,
caption  = "Fully adjusted survey-weighted odds ratios for perceived MCED value.",
col.names = c("Term", "OR", "Lower 95% CI", "Upper 95% CI", "p-value")
) %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

```

In the fully adjusted, survey-weighted logistic regression model, high trust in one’s doctor remained significantly associated with perceived MCED value. Adults reporting a lot of trust in their doctor had 1.36 times higher odds of perceiving MCED tests as highly valuable compared with those reporting lower trust (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.08–1.70). MCED awareness was not associated with perceived value (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.71–1.19). Men had lower odds of perceiving MCED tests as highly valuable than women (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63–0.97), and adults aged 50–64 had higher odds than those aged 18–49 (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.20–1.87), whereas the association among those 65 and older was not statistically significant. Race/ethnicity, education, insurance status, system trust, and household income were not significantly associated with perceived MCED value in the weighted model. However, respondents with lower health literacy had notably lower odds of perceiving MCED tests as highly valuable than those with high health literacy (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50–0.86).


##interaction test
#Effect modification by age group
```{r}
# Interaction model: trust_high * age_cat

mod_int_age <- svyglm(
val_high ~ trust_high * age_cat + Sex + race_cat + education3 +
insured + hl_high + sys_trust_high + income3 + aware,
design = mced_design,
family = quasibinomial()
)

# Wald test for interaction (trust_high × age_cat)

regTermTest(mod_int_age, ~ trust_high:age_cat)


```


##Effect Modification by Age Group
There was evidence of effect modification by age group (p = 0.012). This indicates that the association between trust in doctors and perceived MCED value varies across age categories.
### Model Diagnostics(UNWEIGHTED MODEL)
We assessed model diagnostics using the unweighted fully adjusted logistic regression model.
```{r}
# Unweighted logistic regression for diagnostics

glm_unweighted <- glm(
val_high ~ trust_high + aware +
Sex + age_cat + race_cat + education3 +
insured + hl_high + sys_trust_high + income3,
data   = mced_analysis,
family = binomial()
)

summary(glm_unweighted)

```

## Multicollinearity (VIF)
```{r}
car::vif(glm_unweighted)

```
No multicollinearity was detected, as all variance inflation factors (VIFs) were below 5.

##Hosmer–Lemeshow
```{r}
ResourceSelection::hoslem.test(glm_unweighted$y, fitted(glm_unweighted), g=10)

```

The model fit was adequate based on a nonsignificant Hosmer–Lemeshow test (p = 0.67).

##Influential points

```{r}
plot(glm_unweighted, which=4, id.n=10)



```

No influential points were detected based on Cook's distance.
